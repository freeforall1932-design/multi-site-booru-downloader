# Manual test plan

The automated suite (455 tests) covers the adapters, the shared services, the
panel's shared logic, the mirror-link rules and the message protocol. This document covers what only a
human can check: the real extension in a real browser, the UI states, and the
failure messages a user sees.

Legend: **[V]** = can also be exercised in the offline preview harness
(`npm run preview`) without touching a live site. **[P]** = panel-specific; the
harness embeds the panel at a realistic 380 px with mock data, so it is the
quickest way to see it before installing.

---

## 0. Setup

1. `npm run verify` — type checks, build and tests must all pass.
2. `chrome://extensions` → *Developer mode* → **Load unpacked** → pick `dist/`.
3. Click the toolbar icon → the **side panel** opens (`uiMode: sidepanel`).
   The full manager is still one click away: right-click the icon → *Options*, or
   the panel's *Servers* tab, or *Open side panel* in the options rail.
4. Optional: `npm run preview` → open <http://localhost:4173> for the harness
   (real UI in iframes, mock booru APIs, demo credentials on the page, buttons to
   switch the panel's simulated active tab).

Test profiles you may want, in the order that makes later tests easy:

| Profile | site type | credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e621 main` | e621 | your username + API key, descriptive UA |
| `Danbooru main` | danbooru | your username + API key |
| `Gelbooru main` | gelbooru | API key + numeric user id |
| `e926 read-only` | e621 (base URL `https://e926.net`) | none |
| `Pawchive demo` | pawchive (base URL `https://pawchive.pw`) | none — creator archives are anonymous. In the preview this already exists as *Pawchive (demo creator)* |

---

## 1. Side panel [P]

`[P]` = do this in the real browser (load `dist/` unpacked); the preview harness
covers the same flow with mock data.

1. Click the toolbar icon → the **side panel** opens next to the page. Status pill
   reads *Ready*; the tab strip shows Browse · Queue · Servers · Settings.
2. **Context card.** Open `https://e621.net/posts/<id>` (or a mock URL in the
   harness) → the card names the matching profile and its route (`post #12345`).
   Press ⟳ with a non-booru tab active → the card says the page is not a supported
   booru, and the search box still works.
3. **Post card.** On a post page the card shows a thumbnail, rating chip and size,
   with *Download this post* / *Add to list*. After a download the row shows a
   `saved …` badge; after *Add to list* the button becomes *In the queue*.
4. **Listing.** Type `cityscape` and press *List this page* → rows appear in the
   list below, all ticked, and the dock button reads *Download selected (n)*. The
   hint says how many rows were added and how many were skipped.
5. **Page ranges.** Switch to *advanced*, enter `2,4` and press *Fetch selected
   pages* → the progress bar walks both pages. Enter `abc` → the hint turns red and
   *Fetch selected pages* is disabled. Enter `1-9999` with *Pages per fetch* = 150 →
   the message explains the cap.
6. **Filters.** Set *Media* to *Videos only* → pictures disappear from the list.
   Untick *Skip downloaded*, re-run a search you already downloaded → rows come
   back with a `saved` badge instead of being omitted.
7. **Selective run.** Untick one row, press *Download selected (n)* → only the
   ticked rows run; the unticked row stays `queued`. Press *Start queued (1)* on
   the dock → it downloads too.
8. **Dock controls.** Change *Downloads at once* → the setting persists (Settings →
   *Downloads at once* matches). Switch *Quality* to *Sample* → the next download
   uses the sample URL when the post has one.
9. **Row actions.** ✕ on a queued row removes it from the list (the file on disk is
   untouched); ✕ on a running row cancels just that download. *Retry failed*,
   *Clear finished*, *Reset history* and *Clear list* each report what they did.
10. **Settings tab.** Every section has a heading and a hint. Change *Theme* → the
    panel switches immediately. Tick `{artist}` in the template editor → the
    *Example* line updates. Clear the file-name box and type `post-{id}` → the
    *custom template* warning appears and the value is kept.
11. **Toolbar mode.** Settings → *Toolbar click opens* → *Popup*. Click the toolbar
    icon → the popup opens. Reload the extension → the popup is still the target
    (the worker re-applies the stored choice). Switch back to the panel.
12. **Deep links.** Open `panel.html#queue` (or use the harness button) → the panel
    opens on the Queue tab; `#settings` likewise.

## 1a. Preview harness [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | `npm run preview`, open the harness page | Options + popup iframes render; the harness documents demo credentials and `force:*` directives |
| 1.2 | In the options frame, go to **Browse**, search `cat` | 24-post mock dataset, tiles show previews and rating chips |
| 1.3 | Add a server in the options frame, then reload the page | The new server is still there (shared `localStorage` namespace) |
| 1.4 | Add a server in the options frame, open the popup frame | The same server list appears in the popup (shared state) |
| 1.5 | Press **Reset preview data** on the harness page | Page reloads; the five demo servers are back (e621, Danbooru, Gelbooru, e926, Pawchive) and no user changes remain |
| 1.5a | Open the panel iframe on the **Links** tab and collect `fanbox/1245946` | The demo creator's posts are scanned offline and their mirror links (Mega, Drive, Pixeldrain, MediaFire, Catbox, Dropbox) are collected - see section 5a |
| 1.6 | Search with tag `force:429` | Red error chip: *Rate limited* + a hint about lowering the request interval |
| 1.7 | Search with tag `force:401` | *Authentication failed* (not an endpoint message) |
| 1.8 | Search with tag `force:html` | *Endpoint mismatch* — explains the base URL points at a web page |
| 1.9 | Validate the seeded e621 profile | Success message naming `demo_e621`; the timestamp updates |

---

## 2. Server list [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1 | First run, no profiles | Empty state: *Add server* plus per-site “Add e621 / Add Danbooru / Add Gelbooru” shortcuts |
| 2.2 | Add profile 1 | It becomes the default automatically (`DEFAULT` chip) |
| 2.3 | Add profile 2 | Profile 1 stays the only default; the list shows site type, base URL, rating filter state, login state |
| 2.4 | Press **Set default** on profile 2 | Exactly one default chip; order stays stable |
| 2.5 | Press **Test** on a valid profile | Button shows a busy state, then the row’s status chip becomes green (*Endpoint and credentials OK — signed in as …*) with the current time |
| 2.6 | Press **Test** on a profile with a deliberately wrong key | Red chip *Authentication failed* and the reason is inside the row tooltip/message; no key text anywhere |
| 2.7 | Press **Duplicate** on a profile | A copy appears: label suffixed *copy*, not default, validation reset to unknown, credentials present (`hasApiKey`), no full key visible |
| 2.8 | Press **Delete** on the current default | Row disappears, the next profile is promoted to default automatically |
| 2.9 | Press **Delete** on the last profile | Empty state returns, no errors in the console |

---

## 3. Add / edit form and validation matrix [V]

Open *Servers → Add server* and confirm:

- **Fields**: site type selector, label, base URL, rating-filter toggle + allow-list,
  username, API key, user id, custom User-Agent, plus the site’s helper texts.
  The field set is generated from the adapter (`credentialFields()`), so e621 shows
  a User-Agent hint, Gelbooru shows *user id (numeric)*, Danbooru shows neither.
- **Base URL** is pre-filled with the site default and can be edited (fork/instance).
- **Use suggested** fills a descriptive User-Agent (never a browser-looking string).

Then run the validation matrix. Expected *reason* text, not just red/green:

| # | Scenario | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1 | Correct credentials, correct base URL | Success; account name is displayed (e621/Danbooru) or the profile is marked read/write (Gelbooru) |
| 3.2 | Wildly wrong API key | **Authentication failed** — “rejected the credentials (HTTP 401)”, hint mentions re-copying the key |
| 3.3 | Correct key, wrong **username** (e621/Danbooru) | **Authentication failed** (401) |
| 3.4 | Base URL pointing at the site *web page* (e.g. `https://e621.net/posts`) | **Endpoint mismatch** — HTML/404 message, hint about the base URL |
| 3.5 | Base URL of an unrelated host that answers with HTML | **Endpoint mismatch**, never “authentication failed” |
| 3.6 | Base URL of a host that does not resolve / offline | **Network failure** — DNS/offline wording |
| 3.7 | Gelbooru profile with user id but no API key | **Incomplete configuration** — the pair is required together |
| 3.8 | Site that returns 429/503 (e.g. validate e621 repeatedly, or `force:429` in the harness) | **Rate limited** — distinct message and hint, not auth/endpoint |
| 3.9 | Credentials left blank entirely | Validation succeeds as a **read-only** profile with a warning |
| 3.10 | e621 profile with a `Mozilla/5.0 … Chrome/…` User-Agent | Success plus a warning that a browser-like UA violates the site policy |
| 3.11 | Plain `http://` base URL | Success plus a plain-HTTP warning |
| 3.12 | Cancel while validation is running | UI returns to idle; no unhandled rejection in the console |

Form behaviour:

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.13 | Edit an existing profile | Fields are pre-filled; the API key shows the masked placeholder, leaving it untouched keeps the stored key |
| 3.14 | Save with a failed validation | Warns and offers **Save anyway**; the failure reason is stored on the profile |
| 3.15 | Change the base URL or credentials and save | Validation state resets to unknown (old success must not be trusted) |
| 3.16 | Reload the options page | The last validation result, message and timestamp are still shown |

---

## 4. Browse [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1 | *Browse* → choose a server, search a common tag | Grid of posts with previews, ratings, dimensions, post links |
| 4.2 | Search `-rating:explicit` on a site whose filter allows explicit | Results contain no explicit posts |
| 4.3 | Toggle the rating filter off in the browse toolbar | The filter is preserved per server config and the applied tags are shown |
| 4.4 | Press **Load more** | Next page appends (e621 uses page tokens; Danbooru/Gelbooru use `page`/`pid`) |
| 4.5 | Search nonsense tags | Empty state, no error |
| 4.6 | Search `force:html` (preview) | Red *Endpoint mismatch* error, retry possible |
| 4.7 | Select two posts → **Queue selected (2)** | Toast/confirmation and the queue tab shows the two items |
| 4.8 | Press **Download** on one post | File is saved, the post card shows the saved filename |

## 5. Queue [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | Queue 5 posts → **Start** | Items progress pending → running → done; summary counters update; the button shows *Running…* |
| 5.2 | Press **Pause** mid-run | No new items start; running items finish |
| 5.3 | **Resume** | Work continues |
| 5.4 | Cancel a pending item | Status becomes *canceled*, counters update |
| 5.5 | Queue the same post twice (via browse + popup) | Second attempt is ignored as a duplicate (pending/running de-duplication) |
| 5.6 | Queue an explicit post on a safe-only profile | It is reported as skipped by the rating filter, not downloaded |
| 5.7 | Break a profile’s key, then run its queue | Items fail with the *Authentication failed* kind; error text contains no credentials |
| 5.8 | **Retry failed** | Failed items return to pending and re-run |
| 5.9 | **Clear done** / **Clear all** | Only the matching rows disappear |
| 5.10 | Close the options page during a run, reopen the queue | Progress is intact (persisted state), running items resume from pending after a browser restart |
| 5.11 | Queue a post on a server whose profile was deleted meanwhile | Skip with *Unsupported site type* reason instead of an infinite retry loop |

## 5a. Mirror links (Links tab) [V]

The preview harness ships a demo creator whose posts carry mirror links, so the
whole flow - collect, queue, export, import - can be walked without a live site.
On a real profile, `pawchive` / `kemono` / `coomer` are the site types that can
collect (the tab says *archive API*); any other profile disables the Collect
button on purpose.

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5a.1 | Panel → **Links**, pick the Pawchive profile | Card renders with an empty state; *Collect links* stays disabled until a query is typed |
| 5a.2 | Type `fanbox/1245946`, press **Collect links** | Progress strip ("Scanned n/N"), then rows grouped under post titles; summary reads `6 collected`, and every provider row has a badge (Mega, Google Drive, Pixeldrain, MediaFire, Catbox, Dropbox) |
| 5a.3 | Inspect the collected rows | No `pawchive.pw` or `n1.pawchive.pw` rows (the site's own files are ordinary post downloads) and no `example.com/gallery/1234` row (the default filter keeps downloads only) |
| 5a.4 | Press **Stop** mid-collection | It stops after the post in flight; everything found so far is kept and the button returns to *Collect links* |
| 5a.5 | Settings → *Mirror links* → set **Only download-looking links** to *Every external link*, re-collect | The gallery link now appears; the toolbar button in the Links tab reads `filter: every external link` |
| 5a.6 | Tick a few rows → **Add to download queue (n)** | Toast; the Queue tab shows the rows with a `link` badge; the Links rows read *in the queue*; nothing hits the site's own API |
| 5a.7 | Run the queue | Link rows download through the browser's downloader into `mirrors/<host>/…` (per the template), slowly, one URL per row; a row to a hosting page that needs a login fails and keeps its error text |
| 5a.8 | **Export .txt** (grouped by post) | A `<creator>_download_links.txt` file downloads; it starts with `# Booru Server Manager — collected mirror links`, lists `# Post: <title> — <url>` sections and one `- <url>` line per link |
| 5a.9 | **Clear list** → confirm | The list empties; pending link rows leave the queue; a running download is not killed; the file on disk stays |
| 5a.10 | **Import .txt…** → pick the file just exported | Rows come back grouped by their post titles, summary matches the export, the dock notice reports how many were added/known/unreadable; new rows arrive ticked |
| 5a.11 | Press **Add to download queue (n)** right after importing | The imported URLs queue (and download) exactly like collected ones - no profile is needed for the rows themselves |
| 5a.12 | Import a hand-written list (`Mega link`, a plain URL, a `•` bullet, a nonsense line) | Valid URLs are added regardless of provider, the nonsense line is counted as unreadable, nothing throws |
| 5a.13 | Reload the panel (and the browser) | The collected list and each row's status (queued/done/failed, saved filename) are still there - `bsm.links` is persistent storage |
| 5a.14 | Feed a userscript export (the `Creator:`/`Collected:` preamble, bare URLs) into **Import .txt…** | It imports: `#` lines are comments, bullets are stripped, duplicates collapse |
| 5a.15 | Set **Mirror folder template** to `mirrors/{provider}/{date}` and queue one link | The saved path follows the URL tokens (`mirrors/Mega/2026-09-29/<name>`), not the post's naming template |

## 6. Downloads and naming [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6.1 | Default templates | Files land in `Downloads/booru/<siteType>/<id>_<md5>.<ext>` |
| 6.2 | Set folder `booru/{siteLabel}/{rating}`, filename `{artist}-{id}` | Paths match, illegal characters replaced, unknown tokens collapse quietly |
| 6.3 | Template producing a very long filename (`{tag1}_{tag2}_…`) | Filename is capped (~180 chars) and a warning explains the shortening |
| 6.4 | Template with `../` or `..\` | Traversal is neutralised; the file still lands inside the download folder |
| 6.5 | Download the same post twice | The second file is uniquified (`… (1).jpg`), nothing is overwritten |
| 6.6 | Post with a video extension | `{isVideo}` renders `video`; the file downloads normally |

## 7. Settings [V]

The options page and the panel's Settings tab render the same sections; check one
of each area rather than all of them twice: *Global behaviour* (toolbar mode),
*Multiple download* (concurrency, spacing, retries, duplicates), *Mirror links*
(filter, extra hosts, folder template), *List results*
(media filter, page cap, queue rows, skip downloaded), *Search behaviour* (suffix,
blacklist, search history), *Name template* (checkboxes + custom + preview),
*Interface*, *Advanced behaviour*, *Server credentials*, *Download history*.

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.1 | Change templates/concurrency | **Save settings** persists; reopening the page keeps them |
| 7.2 | **Reset to defaults** | Defaults restored |
| 7.3 | Turn off *Enforce rating filter on download* | A single post download of an excluded rating now succeeds |
| 7.4 | Turn off *User-Agent rewriting* then press **Re-sync User-Agent rules** | Report shows 0 rules applied; e621 requests fall back to `_client` |
| 7.5 | **Export servers (no keys)** | JSON download contains no credential values (open the file and search for the key) |
| 7.6 | **Export with keys** | Explicit confirmation first; the file then contains the keys — handle with care |
| 7.7 | **Import servers** with an exported file | Profiles appear, exactly one default, duplicates handled gracefully |
| 7.8 | Import the same file twice | No duplicated profiles (or a clear skipped count) |
| 7.9 | **Delete all stored keys** | Every profile reports `hasApiKey = false`; validation switches to read-only |
| 7.10 | Theme switch | Light/dark/system applies immediately |

## 8. Diagnostics [V]

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8.1 | Open *Diagnostics* | Version, environment, storage keys, adapter catalog (site, auth style, limits, docs link) and saved servers |
| 8.2 | Validate a profile, then open Diagnostics | This profile’s probe trace is listed: probe label, redacted URL, status, duration, interpretation |
| 8.3 | **Copy diagnostics** | Clipboard contains a report; paste it and search for the API key **and** its last 4 characters → no matches |
| 8.4 | Check the browser console for every flow above | No credential values, no unhandled errors |
| 8.5 | Custom/fork host without host permission | Diagnostics shows the granted/permission-needed state, with a **Grant access** action |

## 9. Popup and page flow (real browser)

The popup's *Panel* button opens the docked panel (`chrome.sidePanel.open`, which
needs the click as its user gesture); on a browser without the sidePanel API the
button falls back to the options page.

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9.1 | Open a supported **post** page (e621/Danbooru/Gelbooru) in the active tab | Popup shows *This page* with the detected site, matching server (or an “add this site” prompt), and the post card |
| 9.2 | Press **Download** | File saved with the configured naming; the popup reports the filename |
| 9.3 | Press **Queue** | Item appears in the queue footer; *Start* runs it |
| 9.4 | Open a **tag/search** page instead | Popup offers *Search these tags* against the matching server |
| 9.5 | Open an unrelated page | Popup reports that the page is not a supported booru page, and offers the manager |
| 9.6 | No servers configured at all | Popup shows the empty state with **Open server manager** |

## 10. Content-script button

| # | Steps | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10.1 | Enable *Show the on-page download button* (Settings), open a post page | Floating “⬇ Download with Booru Manager” button appears (shadow DOM, page styles unaffected) |
| 10.2 | Press it | Button text → *Downloading…* → success message with the filename |
| 10.3 | Press it twice | Second press re-downloads (uniquified file) and reports accordingly |
| 10.4 | Disable the setting and reload the page | Button no longer appears |
| 10.5 | Open a post page from a host with no saved profile | Button reports that no server matches the page (link to the manager) |

## 11. Regression checklist for a new site adapter

1. Add the adapter file + registration line, then `npm test` — the conformance
   suite must pass without touching shared code.
2. New site type appears in *Add server* automatically (no UI change was made).
3. Add a profile, validate it, browse it, download one post, queue three.
4. Confirm the failure matrix in section 3 holds for the new site (wrong key,
   wrong base URL, offline, throttling).
5. Update the README table and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` notes.

## 12. Cleanup

- Delete test profiles (or **Delete all stored keys**), then check
  `chrome://extensions` → *Details → Site access* to revoke any host permissions
  you granted for custom instances.
- Preview harness: press **Reset preview data** (or clear `bsm-preview:*` keys in
  DevTools → Application → Local Storage).
